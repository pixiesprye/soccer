Juan Mata exudes class, intelligence and panache – and not just with a ball at his feet. 
The Reds’ no.8 has asserted himself as one of our key performers during his time at Old 
Trafford, regularly contributing important goals and assists. That includes a stunning 
scissor kick at Liverpool in March 2015, and his display on Merseyside was nothing short 
of mesmeric. Performances like these elevated Juan to the status of a fans' favourite.
