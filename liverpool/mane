Sadio Mane has established himself as one of the best forwards in world football during his time at Liverpool. 
Signed from Southampton in the summer of 2016, Mane’s levels have increased year-on-year to help deliver major 
honours to Anfield. After taking the club’s No.10 shirt ahead of 2018-19 - a season during which he committed 
his long-term future to the club - the Senegal international scored 26 times in 50 appearances across all 
competitions to help the Reds win the Champions League, their first piece of silverware since his arrival.
