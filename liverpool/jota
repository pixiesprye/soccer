Diogo Jota provided further Premier League-proven quality in Jürgen Klopp’s Liverpool squad after signing a long-term 
deal to join from Wolverhampton Wanderers in September 2020. The new Reds No.20 had netted 16 goals in 67 top-flight 
outings in the previous two seasons as Wolves recorded successive seventh-place finishes, plus nine Europa League strikes 
during a run to the quarter-finals in 2019-20.
